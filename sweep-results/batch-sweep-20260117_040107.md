# Batch Size Sweep Results

**Model:** qwen3-235b-thinking
**Date:** Sat Jan 17 04:01:07 AM UTC 2026
**System:** AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (Strix Halo)

## Test Parameters
- Performance: 3 runs, 200 tokens each
- Stability Burst: 20 simultaneous requests
- Stability Concurrent: 16 parallel requests

## Results

| Batch Size | Tokens/sec | Avg Time | Burst Test | Concurrent | GPU Errors | Stability |
|------------|------------|----------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 128 | 10.05 | 19.89s |  |  |  |  |
| 256 | 10.10 | 19.79s |  |  |  |  |
| 384 | 10.07 | 19.85s |  |  |  |  |
| 512 | 10.07 | 19.85s |  |  |  |  |
| 768 | 10.17 | 19.64s |  |  |  |  |
| 1024 | 10.06 | 19.87s |  |  |  |  |

## Recommendations

Based on the sweep results, choose a batch size that:
1. Has STABLE status (no GPU crashes)
2. Maximizes tokens/sec for your workload
3. Handles your expected concurrent load

Note: Lower batch sizes are more stable but may have slower prompt processing.
Higher batch sizes process prompts faster but risk GPU scheduler crashes under load.
