## Recommendations

Based on the sweep results, choose a batch size that:
1. Has STABLE status (no GPU crashes)
2. Maximizes tokens/sec for your workload
3. Handles your expected concurrent load

Note: Lower batch sizes are more stable but may have slower prompt processing.
Higher batch sizes process prompts faster but risk GPU scheduler crashes under load.
